# Dynamic Metadata
- By using an exported function named `generateMetadata`, we can add dynamic metadata to the page.
- It can be used as a async function to fetch the data and use it as metadata.

# Error - reset
- To catch the errors in the layouts, we need to move the error boundary to the parent component.
